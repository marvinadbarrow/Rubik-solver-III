6a scramble - pair solved, rotated U, on level 33, 
corner was b, w, r
pperpendicular to face 2. I.e corner is on 1 and edge is on 2
solved edge yes (identity solve)

but on U  turn, 
corner is r b w
parallel is compared to wrong edge, right, should be front;
edge orientation is correct [b,r]
axis of white is correct, but because red is up this gives an anti identity F2L which has no solved edge. 
edge index 3
corner index 3
