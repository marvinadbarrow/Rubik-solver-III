I actually came across lesson 2 first, while looking for a way to convert RGB to HSV, to help with recognizing colours of a Rubik's cube; I'm programming an app to solve scrambled cubes.  I was fiddling with the colour slider on Google 'color picker'  to see if I could find any pattern in the RGB, and just happened to notice the increasing/decreasing percentages in the HSV output.  It occurred to me that, since the colours can vary depending on lighting conditions, and even multiple facets of the same colour, on the same face of the cube,  can have differing RGB values,  maybe the hue value in HSV might be a better fit for establishing facet colours, using a percentage range.  The varying RGB was causing me to despair, while trying to figure out general rules for the six colours.  So I thought, "why not find out how to convert to HSV and see if it can work?" 

Went back to the first video  to get some grounding,  took notes, and checked values I saved from testing the app.  Your concise descriptions in lesson 1 made it not too difficult to figure out a solution.  And I've come back to complete the lessons.  When I sat down yesterday afternoon, I had no idea that I would have a reasonably accurate solution within a day.  Lots more testing to do, of course, but so far, so good. AND, I've learned something new; what HSV is, and how it relates to RGB.  Thanks for the lessons; you've spared me several headaches.
